# 📈 Market Prediction and Analysis  

An end-to-end machine learning project to **predict stock market movements**, analyze technical indicators, and compare investment strategies.  
This project demonstrates how machine learning can enhance financial decision-making by integrating **feature engineering, model backtesting, trading signals, and performance analysis**.

## 🔍 Project Overview  

The goal of this project is to build predictive models for the **S&P 500 index**, evaluate their accuracy, and test their effectiveness against a traditional **Buy-and-Hold strategy**.  
Key steps include:  

- Data preprocessing & feature engineering (RSI, MACD, moving averages).  
- Backtesting baseline and advanced models.  
- Generating **buy/sell trading signals**.  
- Visualizing performance with confusion matrices, equity curves, and feature importance.

## ✨ Features  

- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on historical S&P 500 data.  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models** (Random Forest Classifier).  
- 🔁 **Backtesting Framework** for realistic evaluation.  
- 📈 **Trading Signal Generation** (buy/sell markers on stock prices).  
- 🔍 **Technical Indicators** (RSI, MACD).  
- ⚖️ **Performance Benchmarking** (Model Strategy vs. Buy-and-Hold).  
- 🔑 **Feature Importance Analysis** for interpretability.
